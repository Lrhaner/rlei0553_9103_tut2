# Interacting with the Work

By changing the transparency, the transparency of the orange and yellow rectangles changes from dark to light and then from light to dark in a cycle, creating a twinkling star effect. At the same time, when the mouse is clicked, all the grids will change to random colors, and the twinkling star effect will disappear.

## Driving Mechanism

**Time-Based**

## Animated Properties

In my work, I changed the color of the image, while other students mainly changed the size and display of the components.

## Inspiration

Although the basis of our work was Piet Mondrian's 'Broadway Boogie Woogie', we used the colours of Starry Night to refine our group work. For the individual assignment, I looked at the work of Petros Vrellis, who made Starry Night appear to be flowing, so I followed this change and made the "stars" twinkle.
